# Code Review Task

Perform comprehensive code review. Be thorough but concise.

## Check For:

**Logging** - No console.log statements, uses proper logger with context
**Error Handling** - Try-catch for async, centralized handlers, helpful messages
**TypeScript** - No `any` types, proper interfaces, no @ts-ignore
**Production Readiness** - No debug statements, no TODOs, no hardcoded secrets
**React/Hooks** - Effects have cleanup, dependencies complete, no infinite loops
**Performance** - No unnecessary re-renders, expensive calcs memoized
**Security** - Auth checked, inputs validated, RLS policies in place
**Architecture** - Follows existing patterns, code in correct directory
